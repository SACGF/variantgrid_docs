# Genes

Menu: **[genes]**

In VariantGrid a gene is defined by a gene ID. This is either an Ensembl or RefSeq gene ID depending on the configuration of the installation. All gene annotations, including gene symbols and aliases are linked to this ID. If an installation is configured to use Ensembl, all genes will have an Ensembl ID and then RefSeq IDs will be matched to Ensembl where possible to allow users to search and classify by RefSeq ID. The converse is true if the installation is configured to use RefSeq as the native gene set.

A table of all genes stored in the database and their corresponding annotation data can be found on the genes page  **[genes] -> [genes]**. Use the genome build toggle at the top of the page and then select the appropriate gene annotation set using the 'Gene Annotation Release' dropdown. This dropdown allows access to historical versions of the gene annotations for auditing purposes.

The data in the gene annotation grid can be explored using the OMIM quick filters that will filter to genes with corresponding OMIM data. Alternatively, use the search link to access the advanced filter. Enter a gene symbol in the 'Jump to gene' dropdown or click on the gene symbol in the grid to navigate directly to a gene symbol page.
