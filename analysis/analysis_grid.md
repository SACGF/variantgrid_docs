# Analysis Grid

The 1st column (ID) is special and contains a check box, a numbered link and an IGV logo. The check box is used to select rows manually. The link loads detailed information about that variant above the grid. The IGV link will view the locus in IGV (loading bam files associated with samples). See IGV Integration page. Clicking on a row highlights it. Select the "tagging" tab, then click on a label to tag/colour the row.
