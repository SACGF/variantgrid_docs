## Intro

VariantGrid has a number of installations. Please visit the individual sites for login/registration details. 

### Cloud servers

* [variantgrid.com](http://variantgrid.com) - Research cloud server
* [runx1db](https://runx1db.runx1.com) - Rare disease exome sharing
* [Shariant](https://shariant.org.au) - [Australian Genomics](https://www.australiangenomics.org.au/) variant classification sharing platform

### Private server

There is a VariantGrid private server inside [SA Pathology](https://www.sapathology.sa.gov.au), the public pathology provider to the South Australian Health. 

The advantages of a private server are being restricted to a private intranet, and being able to analyse private patient data without worrying about it being on the cloud.
