# Mutational signatures

Different types of cancer can have consistent somatic variants, see [Signatures of mutational processes in human cancer, Alexandrov et al 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12477)

Mutational signatures are calculated during [VCF import](vcf_samples.md) when the sample is detected as _somatic only_  

Menu: **[data]** -> Sort samples grid by "Mutational Signature" column -> Click on entry.

Or click on the link in the "Mutational Signatures" at the bottom of the sample page.   

Thanks to Paul Wang from the ACRF Cancer Genomics Facility for the code.
