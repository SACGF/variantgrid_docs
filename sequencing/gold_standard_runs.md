# Gold Standard Runs

The administrator can mark a [sequencing run](sequencing_runs.md) as "Gold Standard" - which means it has passed validation / is of sufficient quality to be used as a benchmark for other runs.

Gold standard runs have an icon (![](images/gold-medal.png)) on the sequencing run grid.

Gold runs for an enrichment kit are used:

* In boxplots on QC metrics pages for a [sequencing run](sequencing_runs.md) or other sample QC graphs.   
* To calculate average [gene coverage](../genes/gene_coverage.md) on the [GeneGrid](../genes/genegrid.md) page.
