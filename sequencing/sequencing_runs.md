# Sequencing Runs

When VariantGrid has access to a network drive (eg a diagnostic lab intranet) it can scan disks for sequencing runs to collect QC metrics, gene coverage and automatically load VCFs. [More information on sequencing features](sequencing_details.md)

We collect Sequencing QC metrics and display them with interactive graphs. Collecting data over time allows us to see how this run compares to other runs over time (or vs [gold standard runs](../sequencing/gold_standard_runs.md)).
