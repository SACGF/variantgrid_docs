# Classification Report

## Running the report

To generate the report from a classification, open the classification and scroll to the bottom. You will see a button called "Report". Click on it and you will then be able to copy & paste the report contents into a document.

## Configuring the report

The report can only be configured by admin users - see [admin docs](https://variantgrid-admin-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classification/classification_report.html)
