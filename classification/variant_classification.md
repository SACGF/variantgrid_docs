# Variant Classifications

## Creating Classifications

* From analysis
* From classification page
* From variant details page

## Autopopulation

When you create a classification from inside the system, a number of fields are auto-populated from annotation and sample information.

## API

Variants created from the external API are not auto-populated with values from annotation. 

## Editing

See the [Classification Form](variant_classification_form).

## Configuring Fields

An administrator can add/remove EvidenceKeys which are used to create fields.

They can also hide visible fields on a per-lab basis.
