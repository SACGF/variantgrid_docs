# Variant Classifications

## Creating Classifications

* From an analysis (see [analysis classification workflow](../analysis/analysis_classification.md))
* From the [variant details page](../annotation/variant_details.md)
* Via API (See [Shariant API docs](https://shariant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration/api/classification_post.html))

## Autopopulation

When you create a classification from inside the system, a number of fields are auto-populated from annotation and sample information.

Variants created from the external API are not auto-populated with values from annotation. 

## Editing

See the [Classification Form](variant_classification_form).

## Configuring Fields

An administrator can add/remove EvidenceKeys which are used to create fields.

They can also hide visible fields on a per-lab basis.
