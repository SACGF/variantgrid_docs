# Representative Transcript

SnpEff calculates the damage effects for each transcript. The representative transcript is chosen as:

1. The most damaging transcript
2. If equally damaging, the canonical transcript defined by Ensembl is selected
3. If no canonical transcript exists, the longest transcript is selected. If more than one canonical transcript exists, the longest canonical transcript is selected.
